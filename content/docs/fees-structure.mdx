description: Fee structure of MetEngine

MetEngine's infrastructure relies on high-performance servers, multiple RPCs for redundancy, continuous development, and ongoing UX improvements. Our fee model is designed to cover these costs while keeping the platform affordable, transparent, and built to scale.

**0.5% Swap Fee**: 100% discount on blue-chip tokens, lowest of all trading terminals

> Our swaps provide the best rates, low slippage, and are MEV protected. 

**3% Fee on Earned Yield**: We charge 3% on the fees you generate from your LP position, and no fees on deposits.
